# Image-Classification-Deep-Learning-Model
This is my deep learning project where I used Jupiter Notebook to create an image classification model in Python.
I carried out data preprocessing before building, training, testing, then lastly, evaluating my models. 
My model is able to identify 10 different types of food images, come take a look!
